# Exploring water-ecosystem dynamics at flux sites

This repo contains exploratory analyses into water-ecosystem dynamics
mediated by root zone storage capacity, based on flux site data.

## Data

[FluxDataKit](https://zenodo.org/records/14808331), an extended flux dataset is used, which includes flux tower data from various datasets, including FLUXNET, AmeriFlux, and other regional networks. The dataset is designed to facilitate research on ecosystem-atmosphere interactions, carbon cycling, and water dynamics.
